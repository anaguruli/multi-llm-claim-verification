Nelson Mandela: Imprisonment and Presidency

Nelson Mandela was a South African anti-apartheid activist and leader of the African National Congress (ANC).

Imprisonment:
Mandela was convicted of sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the government at the Rivonia Trial in 1964 and sentenced to life imprisonment. He served 27 years in prison before his release on 11 February 1990.

However, the 27 years were not all spent on Robben Island:
- Robben Island: 1964–1982 (approximately 18 years)
- Pollsmoor Prison, Cape Town: 1982–1988
- Victor Verster Prison, Paarl: 1988–1990

The claim that he was imprisoned on Robben Island for 27 years overstates the time spent at that facility; the full 27-year figure refers to his total imprisonment across three locations.

Presidency:
Following his release, Mandela led the ANC in negotiations to end apartheid. In the South African general election of 27 April 1994—the first election in which all races could vote—the ANC won a majority. Nelson Mandela was inaugurated as President of South Africa on 10 May 1994, becoming the country's first Black and first democratically elected president.

He served one term (1994–1999) and did not seek re-election.
