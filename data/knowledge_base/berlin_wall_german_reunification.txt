The Fall of the Berlin Wall and German Reunification

The Berlin Wall:
The Berlin Wall fell on the night of 9 November 1989. East German authorities announced that citizens could cross the border freely, and crowds immediately began dismantling the wall. This event is widely regarded as the symbolic end of the Cold War, although the Cold War is also dated to the dissolution of the Soviet Union on 26 December 1991.

The wall had divided East and West Berlin since 13 August 1961.

German Reunification:
German reunification occurred on 3 October 1990—not 9 November 1990. This date is now a public holiday in Germany, known as German Unity Day (Tag der Deutschen Einheit).

The reunification process:
- March 1990: First free elections in East Germany
- July 1990: Economic and monetary union
- 3 October 1990: Political reunification — East Germany (the German Democratic Republic) officially ceased to exist and its states joined the Federal Republic of Germany

The Two Plus Four Treaty, signed on 12 September 1990, provided the international framework for reunification by the four WWII Allied powers (USA, USSR, UK, France) plus East and West Germany.
