AI and the Future of Employment

Claims that artificial intelligence will replace all jobs or cause universal unemployment are not supported by mainstream economic research.

Major Research Findings:

McKinsey Global Institute (2023): Estimated that AI could automate 25–46% of work activities by 2030–2045, but distinguished between automating tasks within jobs versus eliminating entire jobs. Most scenarios project job transformation, not elimination.

World Economic Forum (Future of Jobs Report 2023): Estimated that 26% of current jobs could be disrupted by technology by 2027, but that 69 million new jobs would be created while 83 million existing roles disappear—a net displacement of 14 million jobs, not 100% unemployment.

OECD (2023): Approximately 14% of jobs in OECD countries are at high risk of automation, with another 32% likely to change significantly. Historical precedent (agricultural revolution, industrial revolution) shows technology transforms labour markets without permanent mass unemployment.

Oxford Study (Frey & Osborne, 2013): The widely-cited study that estimated 47% of US jobs were at risk was a worst-case scenario; subsequent research significantly revised these estimates downward.

Economic consensus: Economists broadly agree that AI will change the nature of work substantially, may cause transitional unemployment in affected sectors, and may exacerbate inequality—but predictions of 100% unemployment are not found in credible academic or institutional research.
