Treaty of Versailles: Facts and Historical Context

The Treaty of Versailles was the primary peace settlement following World War I. Key facts:

Date of signing: The Treaty of Versailles was signed on 28 June 1919 in the Hall of Mirrors at the Palace of Versailles, France. It was not signed in 1918. The armistice that ended the fighting was signed on 11 November 1918, which is why that date is sometimes confused with the peace treaty.

Key provisions: The treaty held Germany responsible for the war (War Guilt Clause, Article 231), required Germany to pay reparations (eventually set at 132 billion gold marks), stripped Germany of territory, and severely restricted the German military.

The Great Depression: The Great Depression began in 1929, a full decade after the treaty. Historians identify multiple contributing causes:
- The US stock market crash of October 1929
- Bank failures across the United States and Europe
- The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act (1930), which reduced international trade
- Overproduction in agriculture and industry during the 1920s
- Tight monetary policy by the Federal Reserve

While the Versailles reparations contributed to German economic instability and European financial fragility, historians do not identify the treaty as the direct or sole cause of the Great Depression. John Maynard Keynes famously criticised the treaty's economic terms in "The Economic Consequences of the Peace" (1919), but even he did not predict the Depression.

The causal chain from Versailles to the Great Depression is indirect and contested.
