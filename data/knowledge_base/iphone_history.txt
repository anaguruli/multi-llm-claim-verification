The Original iPhone: Launch Features and Timeline

Apple introduced the first iPhone at Macworld Conference & Expo on 9 January 2007. It went on sale to the public on 29 June 2007 in the United States.

Original iPhone Features (2007):
- 3.5-inch multi-touch display
- 2-megapixel camera (no front-facing camera)
- Mobile Safari browser
- iPod music player
- Visual Voicemail
- Google Maps integration
- Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
- EDGE (2G) network connectivity — NOT 3G

Features NOT present at original launch:
- App Store: Apple launched the App Store on 10 July 2008, alongside iPhone OS 2.0. Third-party applications were not available at the original launch.
- 3G connectivity: The original iPhone used EDGE (2.5G) for cellular data. The iPhone 3G, released on 11 July 2008, was the first iPhone with 3G connectivity.

- MMS messaging

Steve Jobs presented the original iPhone as "an iPod, a phone, and an internet communicator" combined into one device, emphasising the revolutionary touch interface.

The claim that the original iPhone included an App Store and 3G connectivity at launch is incorrect on both counts.
