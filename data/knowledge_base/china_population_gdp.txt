China's Population and Economic Status (2023–2024)

Population:
For decades, China was the world's most populous country. However, according to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and Indian government data, India surpassed China in population in 2023, becoming the world's most populous country with approximately 1.429 billion people versus China's 1.412 billion.

This demographic shift is a significant milestone. China's population began declining due to the long-term effects of the one-child policy (1980–2015), aging demographics, and falling birth rates.

GDP Rankings:
As of 2023:
- Nominal GDP: The United States remains the world's largest economy at approximately $27.4 trillion. China is second at approximately $17.7 trillion. 
- GDP by Purchasing Power Parity (PPP): China is considered the largest economy by some measures of PPP, depending on the methodology used by the IMF or World Bank.

The claim that China has the world's largest economy by nominal GDP is incorrect; it is the second largest.
