Intermittent Fasting and Type 2 Diabetes

Intermittent fasting (IF) has been the subject of growing clinical interest for its potential metabolic benefits. Several studies published between 2018 and 2023 have examined its effects on glycaemic control in individuals with Type 2 diabetes.

A 2022 systematic review published in the journal Nutrients found that various forms of intermittent fasting, including time-restricted eating and alternate-day fasting, can significantly reduce HbA1c levels, fasting blood glucose, and body weight in people with Type 2 diabetes. The improvements were comparable to continuous caloric restriction.

A 2023 study from the University of Illinois Chicago, not Harvard, reported that time-restricted eating helped some patients achieve remission from Type 2 diabetes, meaning they maintained normal blood sugar levels without medication. The study involved 75 participants and found remission rates of around 50% over the study period—not 80%.

No 2023 Harvard study claiming to prove that intermittent fasting reverses Type 2 diabetes in 80% of patients has been identified in peer-reviewed literature. The claim appears to be a fabrication combining real research themes with false specifics.

The American Diabetes Association notes that diabetes remission is possible through weight loss interventions including dietary changes, but outcomes vary substantially by individual and long-term maintenance is challenging.
