US Unemployment: Historical Data and the 2008 Financial Crisis

The 2008 Financial Crisis and Unemployment:
The 2008 global financial crisis triggered by the collapse of the US housing market led to a significant rise in unemployment. According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS):

- January 2008: US unemployment rate was 5.0%
- Peak unemployment: 10.0% in October 2009
- Recovery: Unemployment gradually declined through the 2010s, reaching pre-crisis levels around 2015–2016

The unemployment rate never reached 25% during or after the 2008 crisis. The 10% peak was the highest since the early 1980s recession.

The Great Depression Comparison:
The 25% unemployment figure refers to the Great Depression. US unemployment peaked at approximately 24.9% in 1933, the worst point of the Depression. Some estimates place it even higher when accounting for underemployment and workers who had given up seeking employment.

The 2008–2009 recession is sometimes called the "Great Recession" but was substantially less severe than the Great Depression in terms of unemployment magnitude.
