Global GDP Growth Rates and Economic History

Global GDP growth refers to the year-over-year increase in the total economic output of all countries combined.

2023 GDP Growth:
According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) World Economic Outlook (April 2024), global GDP growth in 2023 was 3.1%. The World Bank's estimate was similar at 2.6%. Neither organisation reported anything near 15% growth.

Historical Context:
The fastest periods of global economic growth in recorded history include:
- Post-World War II reconstruction (1950s–1960s): Global growth rates of 4–5% annually in some years
- Post-2020 pandemic recovery (2021): Global GDP rebounded by approximately 6.0% after contracting 3.1% in 2020
- The 1960s saw high growth rates in developed economies

A 15% global GDP growth rate has never been recorded in modern economic history. Such a figure would represent the combined output growth of all nations simultaneously expanding at extraordinary rates, which has no historical precedent.

The claim of 15% growth in 2023 overstates actual performance by approximately five times.
