Exercise, Cardiovascular Health, and Mental Health

The health benefits of regular moderate-intensity aerobic exercise are among the most robustly established findings in medical science.

Cardiovascular Benefits:
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends at least 150–300 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week for adults. A landmark 2018 meta-analysis published in the Lancet, analysing data from over 1.2 million individuals, found that exercise reduced the risk of cardiovascular disease by 35%.

The American Heart Association (AHA) notes that regular physical activity lowers blood pressure, reduces LDL cholesterol, helps maintain healthy weight, and reduces the risk of coronary artery disease, heart attack, and stroke.

A 2021 Cochrane review of 197 randomised controlled trials found that exercise interventions consistently reduced all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality.

Mental Health Benefits:
A 2018 study in Lancet Psychiatry analysed data from 1.2 million Americans and found that individuals who exercised regularly had 43% fewer days of poor mental health per month.

Exercise is recommended by NICE (UK), the APA (US), and WHO for the management of depression and anxiety. Meta-analyses show effect sizes for exercise on depression comparable to antidepressant medication in mild-to-moderate cases.

Mechanisms include increased BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor), reduced cortisol, increased endorphins, and improved sleep quality.
